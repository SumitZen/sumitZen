Hi there! 😁

I’m sumit, a web dev based in India.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing. 

Fun Facts:
I don’t like coffee or tea.
Attack On Tittan is my favorite anime.
